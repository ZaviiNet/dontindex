title: Another day another reflash
---

So lets start.
I spent the best parts of 3 days trying to bluetooth pocketchip to my bluetooth speaker I tried all the guides and lots of software and nope it didn't work :( so just as I had everything done with the amount of software I had that did not work I reflashed back to the start.... sigh. 

So here I am 3 hours later everything back installed I'm ready to start blogging again.
This week Im at RTXLondon for my second year, This year I'm crewing so I have to be there 2 days sooner but yay for new friends and yay for travelling first class 

So wrapping up todays blog for now see you in the next!
